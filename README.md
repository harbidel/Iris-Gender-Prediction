# Iris-Gender-Prediction
# Iris gender prediction using Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm 
Setting up Our Image Data
Since we are working on an IRIS image classification problem, a total of 274 IRIS images was acquired, which was divided into train and test. Train folder having 220 images and the test folder has 54. Both the classes Female and Male have 124 and 150 images respectively.

# Our data structure is as follows:
*	Input – 274
  Train – 220
  * Female – 100
  * Male – 120
  Test – 54
  * Female – 24
  * Maler – 30
